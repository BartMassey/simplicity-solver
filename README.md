["Simplicity"](http://www.puzzlebeast.com/slidingblock/index.html)
is a sliding-blocks puzzle by James W. Stephens.

This solver is written in Java using Pathfinding Search.

This is the starting state of Simplicity.

    ..Y.
    BBYY
    .GR.
    .GRR

The goal is to get the R block to the upper-left corner.

    R???
    RR??
    ????
    ????

A solution will be a sequence of puzzle states in the format
shown above leading from the starting state to a goal state.

The solver uses A* search, with an admissible heuristic of
taxicab distance of the R piece from its goal position. A
back-of-the-envelope calculation gives a strict upper bound
of 64K for the number of possible states of this problem,\
so almost anything works quickly.
